# Task Description

Simulate cd and pwd Commands:

**Description:**

- You're given a list of file system commands like cd, pwd, and a simplified simulation of directory navigation.
- Your task is to simulate the file system traversal and respond to pwd commands with the current absolute path.

**Input Format:**

 - cd [path]: Changes the current directory.

   [path] can be:

   - an absolute path (starts with /)

   - a relative path (e.g., .., folder/../dir)

- pwd: Prints the current working directory

Implement a method that takes a list of strings (commands) and outputs the result of all pwd commands.

**Test Case - I:**

Input:

            [

                "cd /home",

                "cd user",

                "pwd",

                "cd ..",

                "pwd",

                "cd ./projects/../code",

                "pwd"

            ]

 

  Output:

            [

                "/home/user/",

                "/home/",

                "/home/code/"

            ]

 

**Test Case - II:**

Input:

            [

                "cd /",

                "cd home",

                "cd ./user//",

                "cd ../..",

                "cd ../..",

                "cd var/log",

                "pwd",

                "cd /etc/./nginx/../ssh",

                "pwd",

                "cd ..",

                "pwd"

            ]

 
Output:

            [

                "/var/log/",

                "/etc/ssh/",

                "/etc/"

            ]
